# Discount System Implementation Guide

## üéØ **Overview**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the comprehensive discount system in your health club management application. The system includes:

- **Multiple discount types**: Percentage, fixed amount, and free service discounts
- **Employee tracking**: Track which employee applied each discount
- **Reservation-level tracking**: Link discounts to specific reservations
- **Approval workflow**: Control discount application with manager approval
- **Complete audit trail**: Full history of discount applications
- **Permission-based access**: Control who can apply discounts

## üìã **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Database Setup**

1. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations discounts
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create sample discount types**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py setup_discounts
   ```

### **Step 2: Backend Configuration**

1. **Add discounts app to INSTALLED_APPS** (already done in settings.py):
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ... other apps
       'discounts',
   ]
   ```

2. **URL configuration** (already done in urls.py):
   ```python
   router.register(r'discounts/discount-types', DiscountTypeViewSet, basename='discount-type')
   router.register(r'discounts/reservation-discounts', ReservationDiscountViewSet, basename='reservation-discount')
   router.register(r'discounts/discount-rules', DiscountRuleViewSet, basename='discount-rule')
   router.register(r'discounts/discount-application', DiscountApplicationViewSet, basename='discount-application')
   ```

### **Step 3: Permission Setup**

Create permissions for the discount system:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from discounts.models import DiscountType, ReservationDiscount, DiscountRule

# Get content types
discount_type_ct = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(DiscountType)
reservation_discount_ct = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(ReservationDiscount)
discount_rule_ct = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(DiscountRule)

# Create permissions
permissions = [
    ('view_discounttype', 'Can view discount type'),
    ('add_discounttype', 'Can add discount type'),
    ('change_discounttype', 'Can change discount type'),
    ('delete_discounttype', 'Can delete discount type'),
    ('view_reservationdiscount', 'Can view reservation discount'),
    ('add_reservationdiscount', 'Can add reservation discount'),
    ('change_reservationdiscount', 'Can change reservation discount'),
    ('delete_reservationdiscount', 'Can delete reservation discount'),
    ('view_discountrule', 'Can view discount rule'),
    ('add_discountrule', 'Can add discount rule'),
    ('change_discountrule', 'Can change discount rule'),
    ('delete_discountrule', 'Can delete discount rule'),
    ('apply_discount', 'Can apply discount'),
    ('approve_discount', 'Can approve discount'),
]

for codename, name in permissions:
    Permission.objects.get_or_create(
        codename=codename,
        name=name,
        content_type=discount_type_ct if 'discounttype' in codename else 
                   reservation_discount_ct if 'reservationdiscount' in codename else
                   discount_rule_ct if 'discountrule' in codename else discount_type_ct
    )
```

### **Step 4: Frontend Integration**

The frontend integration is already implemented in the ReservationBookingForm component. Key features include:

1. **Discount Selection**: Users can view available discounts and apply them
2. **Discount Preview**: Shows calculated savings before applying
3. **Approval Workflow**: Handles discounts that require manager approval
4. **Applied Discounts**: Shows all applied discounts with ability to remove them
5. **Price Calculation**: Updates total price with discount amounts

### **Step 5: Testing the System**

1. **Create a test reservation** with services
2. **Apply different discount types**:
   - Percentage discounts (e.g., First Time Guest - 20% off)
   - Fixed amount discounts (e.g., Bulk Booking - $5 off)
   - Free service discounts (e.g., VIP Member)
3. **Test approval workflow** for discounts requiring approval
4. **Verify discount tracking** in the admin interface
